# CMOS Oscillator Design and Simulation

## üìå Overview

This project focuses on the **design, simulation, and comparative analysis** of five widely used oscillator topologies using **CMOS technology**. Oscillators are essential components in digital and analog VLSI systems for timing, signal generation, and frequency synthesis. The designs were implemented and simulated using schematic-based tools to evaluate performance across different domains.

1. **3-Stage CMOS Ring Oscillator**
2. **5-Stage CMOS Ring Oscillator**
3. **Colpitts Oscillator**
4. **Hartley Oscillator**
5. **Wien Bridge Oscillator**

Each oscillator type was studied for:
- Working principle  
- Design methodology  
- Frequency of operation  
- Strengths and limitations  
- Simulation-based validation
